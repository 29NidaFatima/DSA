# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java üñ•Ô∏è

This repository is my personal learning journey for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**.  

The goal is to understand **concepts deeply** and **practice problems** to strengthen problem-solving skills.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Data Structures
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stack & Queue
- HashMap & HashSet
- Trees (Binary, BST, Heap)
- Graphs
- Trie

### 2. Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide & Conquer
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)

---

## How I Learn
1. **Understand the theory**: Read about the data structure or algorithm.
2. **Implement in Java**: Write my own code from scratch.
3. **Solve problems**: Practice from online judges like LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks.
4. **Analyze complexity**: Time and space analysis for each solution.

---

## Practice Plan
- Daily coding practice: 1‚Äì2 problems per day.
- Weekly focus: One data structure or algorithm type per week.
- Monthly review: Revisit old topics to reinforce concepts.

---

## Notes
- All code is implemented in **Java**.
- Concepts are documented with comments for understanding.
- Complexity and key observations are noted alongside implementations.

---

### Goal
To **build strong problem-solving skills** and become confident in applying DSA concepts to real-world programming problems.
